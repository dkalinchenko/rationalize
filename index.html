                Rationalize is an easy to use, yet powerful tool for collaboratively analyzing pros and cons of alternatives and coming up with a decision in a group environment.
                While Rationalize can be used for concept evaluation and decision-making in a variety of contexts and use-cases, the process can, effectively, be broken down into 3 main steps:
                <table class="steps-table">

              Rationalize is built with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Pugh'>Stuart Pugh's</a> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-matrix_method'>Decision Matrix</a> as its theoretical backbone. The framework is used to evaluate various alternatives against a baseline using weighted criteria as an input into the decision-making process. The idea is to formalize the decision-making process, making it more rational.
              The framework can be used in business or personal decisions, though it is probably too time-consuming for day-to-day decision-making.
            </p>

              <p>
              Per Wikipedia:
              <br /><blockquote class="blockquote" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-matrix_method"><p><small>The decision-matrix method, also Pugh method or Pugh Concept Selection, invented by Stuart Pugh, is a qualitative technique used to rank the multi-dimensional options of an option set. It is frequently used in engineering for making design decisions but can also be used to rank investment options, vendor options, product options or any other set of multidimensional entities.

                <br />A basic decision matrix consists of establishing a set of criteria options which are scored and summed to gain a total score which can then be ranked. Importantly, it is not weighted to allow a quick selection process.

                <br />A weighted decision matrix operates in the same way as the basic decision matrix but introduces the concept of weighting the criteria in order of importance. The resultant scores better reflect the importance to the decision maker of the criteria involved. The more important the criteria the higher the weighting it should be given. Each of the potential options are scored and also multiplied by the weighting given to each of the criteria in order to produce a result.

                <br />The advantage of the decision making matrix is that subjective opinions about one alternative versus another can be made more objective. Another advantage of this method is that sensitivity studies can be performed. An example of this might be to see how much your opinion would have to change in order for a lower ranked alternative to out rank a competing alternative.

              We decided to build Rationalize because we saw too many organizations struggle with implementing collaborative decision support tools as a part of their processes. While a lot of companies find the frameworks like Pugh Decision Matrix helpful in identifying their priorities, especially in innovation and product development, there were no "off the shelf" tools to perform these functions. As a result, many of these companies had to develop their own software, which is costly and inefficient. We thought we can address that need by developing an easy to use concept evaluation and decision tool that individuals and organizations can use to collaborate and make decisions together.

              <h4> Dmitry "Dima" Kalinchenko </h4>
              <img class='dima' src="img/dima.png" />
              Dima is a management consultant based out of Boulder, Colorado. While working in innovation consulting, Dima has seen many companies (including some that he worked at) develop their own proprietary tools to enable concept evaluation and collaborative decision-making.
              <br /><br />
              He has had the idea to code Pugh’s Decision Matrix into an app since graduate school so the idea of developing a tool which uses decision matrix for collaborative concept evaluation was a no brainer to him.
              <br /><br />
Outside of building products to help the world collaborate better, Dima can be found competing in endurance sports competitions (Ironman and trail running) and sampling craft beer in one of the countless breweries around Boulder, CO.<br /><br />

              <img class='dima' src="img/kraen.jpg" />
Kræn is a software engineer base out of Copenhagen, Denmark. He’s used the decision matrix both professionally and academically (evaluating items on a backlog, evaluating software systems fitness) as well as personally (when deciding to lease or buy a car and to collaborate around evaluating potential real estates). He’s been building multiple spreadsheets with decisionsion matrices at their core, but this final attempt grew into something more…              <br /><br />
When he’s not at a computer coding like mad, Kræn plays with his two identical twin daughters in a nearby park or playground. If he’s not there, he practices Taekwondo (currently 6th KUP) / blue belt) at his local Dojang.              <br /><br />
