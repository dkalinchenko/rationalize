              Rationalize.io is a web app which provides rational structrue to the decision-making process. You can use it to answer questions like:
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  - What career should I pick?
                </li>
                <li>
                  - What kind of car should I buy?
                </li>
                <li>
                  - Which candidate should I hire?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              This framework is based on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Pugh'>Stuart Pugh's</a> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-matrix_method'>Decision Matrix</a>. Per Wikipedia:
              <br /><blockquote class="blockquote" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-matrix_method"><p><small>The decision-matrix method, also Pugh method or Pugh Concept Selection, invented by Stuart Pugh, is a qualitative technique used to rank the multi-dimensional options of an option set. It is frequently used in engineering for making design decisions but can also be used to rank investment options, vendor options, product options or any other set of multidimensional entities.

                <br />A basic decision matrix consists of establishing a set of criteria options which are scored and summed to gain a total score which can then be ranked. Importantly, it is not weighted to allow a quick selection process.

                <br />A weighted decision matrix operates in the same way as the basic decision matrix but introduces the concept of weighting the criteria in order of importance. The resultant scores better reflect the importance to the decision maker of the criteria involved. The more important the criteria the higher the weighting it should be given. Each of the potential options are scored and also multiplied by the weighting given to each of the criteria in order to produce a result.

                <br />The advantage of the decision making matrix is that subjective opinions about one alternative versus another can be made more objective. Another advantage of this method is that sensitivity studies can be performed. An example of this might be to see how much your opinion would have to change in order for a lower ranked alternative to out rank a competing alternative.

              Greetings,
              <br /><br />
              <img class='dima' src="dima.png" />
              I am Dmitry but friends call me Dima. Currently, I am learning JavaScript and attempting to pivot my career from management consulting into a more technical field like UX or Front-End Development.
              <br /><br />
              This app is, basically, my project in learning to code in JavaScript. I have had the idea to code Pugh’s Decision Matrix into an app since I was in grad school and now I’ve finally gotten around to doing that. I am not sure if there are many humans out there who will turn to this amazing piece of software to help them make better decisions, but, as a project to apply the learned JavaScript skills, I think, this is pretty solid.
              <br /><br />
              Outside of attempting to pivot my career every now and then, I also love running triathlons, rock climbing, trail running and everything else that goes along with living in Boulder, Colorado. I would love to connect, so feel free to reach out!
              <br /><br />
              Cheers,<br />
              Dima
